\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

This opening chapter will provide an overview of the research topic, going over the motivation behind the study, the research questions, and the 
methodology. The chapter will also provide a brief outline of the structure of the thesis.

\section{Motivation}

% What are natural languages? why do they exist? How do they develop?
The goal of human language, much like any other human activity is to aid our survival and propagation. It helps us to collaborate, compete and 
influence others \cite{Levshina_2022}. Another hallmark of all living beings is efficiency, as a product of biological evolution \cite{haCostBenefit2010}. 
Thus languages form from a trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency. Thus, languages tend to follow rules like Zipf's Law of Abbreviations CITE, 
that words which are more frequently used tend to be shorter than sparsely used words. 

% Why is natural language not an optimal length code?
This is of course an idealization. In the real world, speakers must talk in noisy environments, which mean that languages often have redundancy
built in. This redundancy helps in error correction and understanding in such noisy environments. In addition, natural languages are not an
optimal code in terms of information theory. This is due to the fact that human languages are constrained by the limitations of incremental
language processing, which enforces constraints which forces systematicity, compositionality and concatenation as means of combination \cite{futrellInformationTheoryBridge2022}.

% Introduction to conlangs, and a brief history of conlangs
Constructed Languages (ConLangs) are languages that have been constructed by an individual or group of individuals rather than having evolved 
naturally \cite{schreyerConstructedLanguages2021}. ConLangs are used for various purposes, such as to serve as an international auxiliary 
language (e.g. Esperanto), to create a fictional world (Dothraki, Klingon, or Quenya), to be logically rigorous. (e.g. Lojban), or to be simple 
and easy to learn (e.g. Toki Pona). Some, like Ithkuil \cite{Ithkuil2024} are designed to express more profound thoughts briefly but clearly. 

% The motivation: what does optimality mean? could we design a constructed language?
Naturally, the next question that arises, is whether we could design a language that is more optimal or efficient than natural languages.
This question itself is more challenging than it seems. What does it mean for a language to be optimal? Is it efficiency in terms of information theory?
Is it ease of learning? Is it expressiveness? Is it the ability to convey complex thoughts? Is it the ability to be understood in even the most noisy environments?
In addition, how do we measure these properties? Therefore the first motivation of this thesis is to explore what it means for a language to be optimal, 
and whether we can design a language that is more optimal than natural languages.

% Motivation: vague idea about how LLMs might have insights into this problem, 
The second motivation of this thesis is to explore whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide insights into this problem.

% Concluding Paragraph: bring together the idea of conlangs, LLMs and the research question.
